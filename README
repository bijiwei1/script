Hi, 

This is an python script suite that can run tests for core or simulator tools and compare the output values. 

Instructions to use scripts:

For core:
	Need to set TESTPATH to the path of top test folder where all tests are located 
 		- EX: export TESTPATH=/testtopfolder/
	Need to set COREPATH to the path of executable file of core 
		- Ex: export COREPATH=/tabbycorefolder/
	1) run-all-tests.py 
		- this script can run all tests in test folder
		- no input needed
	2) run-unit-tests.py 
		- this script can run a unit test with certain name
		- input test name    EX: ./run-unit-tests,py add

For simulator:
	Need to set TESTPATH to the path of top test folder where all tests are located
	Need to set SIMPATH to the path of executable file of simulator
	
	1) sim-all-tests.py 
		- this script can run all tests in test folder
		- no input needed
	2) sim-unit-test.py
		- this script can run a unit test with certain name
		- input test name    EX: ./run-unit-tests,py add
